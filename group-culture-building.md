# Group Culture Building

### Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This activity is important because:*

You're about to start a group project, and discussing group culture beforehand will help that process go more smoothly. 

### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this activity, developers will be able to:*

* Describe three strategies for dealing with blocks they face.

* List areas where their teammate(s) feel strong and areas where their teammate(s) want to grow or might need help.

* Explain how their teammate(s) would like to be supported for difficult challenges.  


### Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

* Identify specific strengths and weaknesses in your abilities. 

* Communicate with a team while working on a technical project. 

## Self-Reflection

Individually, take 5-10 minutes to write down answers to the following questions. 

1. What is a technical area where you feel strong?

1. What is a technical area you'd like to improve?

1. What awesome nontechnical abilities or attitude do you bring to a group?

1. When facing a block, what strategies have been most effective for you to move forward?

1. When you're facing a difficult problem, what support would you like from your teammates?

1. How do you prefer to receive feedback? For example, in email, slack, or in person? 

1. Anything else you'd like your teammates to know about how you work with others?

## Discussion

Share your reflections among your team. 

## Feedback Tips from WDI

- feedback should be clear and specific
- consider the context your teammates will need
  - comments may be better for specific code issues
  - a phone call or in-person talk may be better for addressing workflow issues you need to talk out
- consider the other person's feelings and communication style - and remember you're on the same team
- connect your feedback to the project goals
- give feedback that is actionable and helps others decide what to change or what things to keep doing
- warn others when tough (but constructive!) feedback is coming so they can take a break first or schedule time later if needed
- try a feedback sandwich - give some positives, then some constructive feedback, then more positives
- celebrate teamwork and success! don't forget the positive feedback

## Closing Thoughts

Take note of how you can help each other build something awesome! It will be better than what any of you could do alone!
