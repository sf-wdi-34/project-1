# WDI 34 Project 1 Presentation Guidelines


### Timing

At 9:00AM, be in the room and ready to present your project!

Your presentation should be 6-8 minutes (2 person teams) or 9-12 minutes (3 person teams).  **Each developer MUST present for an equal time during your presentation.**


### Content

The presentation should include:

- Names of each team member
- Motivation for the project
- Demo 
- A snippet (about 3-5 lines) that each of you would like to share, and why it's interesting or why you're proud of it

Also, as you're telling us about the demo or snippets, include:

- Triumphs (1-2 things you're most excited about)
- Challenges (1-2 things that were most difficult, whether they're finished or not) 



### Presentation Tips

- Copy your code snippets and explanation into your readme and/or slides.

- Zoom your browser window to 150%.

- If showing your text editor, zoom in on your text editor or set font size to at least 20px.

- Speak up!
